    <h2>ASC Experience</h2>
        <p> 
            All-Star Code (ASC) was an exciting introduction to coding where we were exposed to many different coding languages including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This program helped us build our technical skills while also enchaning our entrepreneurial mindset.This program encouraged creativity, teamwork, and critical thinking, ultimately laying the foundation for future career paths in Tech.

    <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
        <p> 
            For us, the reason we decided to take up the challenge of coding was due to the creative and freedom aspects of it as well as the way it can serve as a baseline of knowledge. 
            We enjoy how we are able to have full access to what we build without any limitations of how we build it, therefore allowing us to have the freedom to create whilst simultaneously exerting our creativeness.
            We can all agree that through the various lessons and projects provided to us by the All-Star Code team, we were able to become more knowledgeable about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML than we were 3 weeks ago.
